            <h3>• I am a self taught Web Developer with 2 years experience and counting,<br>
                • Learned programming as a calm, patient persistent, confident, dilligent, and most of all, a Problem
                Solver.<br>
                • I believe web development is not just about coding, it is about problem solving too.<br>
                • My focus is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences. <br>
                • Being a self taught developer has given me the mindset of 'I don't know how to do it yet, but I will
                figure it out.' <br>
                • If you hire me as a developer, I promise to figure out how to make your target customers increase by
                making their virtual experience uniquely pleasant while offering online security.
